Chatwoot lets users sort and filter contacts based on different categories by using advanced filters. And now we can save them as segments and will be displayed in the secondary sidebar under the segments section. This feature will help users to custom save different contacts on users views.

You can simply click on the filter button in the header of the contact page.
